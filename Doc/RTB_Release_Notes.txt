----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Version: 1.1.7 (First public release)
Release Date: Februar, 25, 2013
Build: 34346


System requirements for AVR-based MCUs - Supported Compiler/Tools
- Atmel Studio 6.0 (6.0.1843) including AVR GCC 8-bit toolchain
  (Version 3.4.0_663 including GCC version 4.6.2)


Supported devices
Transceivers:
    - AT86RF233

Microcontrollers:
    - ATxmega256A3



Supported hardware platforms
- REB-CBB boards with REB233 (REB233SMAD V8.1.0) with ATXMEGA256A3



Known limitations and issues
- RTB library requires MCU clock speed of 32MHz
- MACless RTB Demo
    - Supports only 79 frequency measurement points
      (compared to 120 frequency points for regular ranging library based applications)
    - Always uses PMU result compression; cannot provide uncompressed PMU results
    - When using MACless RTB Demo as Reflector in conjunction with RTB Eval App
      (as Initiator), make sure:
        - The selected frequency range of the RTB Eval App comprises only a maximum
          of 79 frequencies
        - PMU result compression is always set to 1
        - The MACless RTB Demo does currently not check these parameters, which results
          in timeout errors at the Initiator node (runnign RTB Eval App)
